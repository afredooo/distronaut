# üöÄ Distronaut

**Distronaut** is a tool that travel through the internet to find distribution ISO download links and metadata, making it easier for you to monitor new releases or burn an install media.

## ‚å®Ô∏è CLI

Use `fetch` command to retrieve a JSON from configured sources:
```bash
go run main.go fetch -c config/sources.yml -f 'debian'
```

Output is similar to below:
```json
[
  {
    "Source": "Debian",
    "Family": "Linux",
    "Distribution": "Debian (formerly Debian GNU/Linux)",
    "Website": "http://www.debian.org/",
    "Documentation": "http://www.debian.org/doc/",
    "Status": "Active",
    "Versions": [
      {
        "Url": "https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/11.4.0/amd64/iso-cd/debian-11.4.0-amd64-netinst.iso",
        "Hash": "sha256:d490a35d36030592839f24e468a5b818c919943967012037d6ab3d65d030ef7f",
        "Version": "11.4.0",
        "Arch": "amd64",
        "Meta": {
          "release": "2021-08-14"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

Additional metadata is scrapped from [distrowatch.com](https://distrowatch.com).

## üåï Configuring new sources

Open your configuration file and add a new entry, containing:
- `name` is a friendly name for your new source (can also be used for filtering)
- `url` is the source url pattern
  - each *route parameter* is indicated by a colon (`:`)
- `patterns` is a map containing:
  - `:*` regexs patterns that are matched by *route parameter*
    - each *route parameter* can be back-referenced using `\k<:name>` syntax
  - `.hash.*` contains all hash related settings 
  - `.meta.*` contains all metadata related settings

Example source:
```yml
- name: Debian
  url: https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/:version/:arch/iso-cd/:iso
  patterns:
    :version: ^(\d+\.\d+(?:\.\d+)?)\/$
    :arch: ^(amd64|arm64)\/$
    :iso: ^debian-\k<version>-\k<arch>-netinst\.iso$
    .hash.file: SHA256SUMS
    .hash.algo: sha256
    .hash.pattern: (?m)^([0-9a-f]{64})\s+\k<iso>
    .meta.source: distrowatch
    .meta.id: debian
    .meta.version: (\d+)
```
